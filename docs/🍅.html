    Hungry Mick's
</h2>
<p><a href="albertkemp.github.io/hungry_micks/">Hungry Mick's</a> is an amazing michelin starred restaurant that opened up to serve food for all the Micks in the world. It specialises in serving tomatoey dishes for all tomato lovers and people that are scared of them. Hungry Mick's has many options on the menu including the Dread Burger, which is filled with tomatoes, and the Illegal Sandwich, which so many Micks say is illegaling.</p>
